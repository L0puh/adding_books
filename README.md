just trying to get how things're working in cpp....

# todo:
### server:
- [ ] server: send message to specific client
- [ ] server: clean sockets after closing connection
- [x] server: send msg bigger than 1 byte
- [x] server FIX: omit messages from the same client
### networking:
- [ ] network: send packages instead of messages
- [x] network: fix quiting the client (server crashes)
- [ ] network: fix sending data
