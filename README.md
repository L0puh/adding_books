my first project in c++, just for practice 


### todo:
- [ ] get into OOP (make classes??)
- [ ] cmake 

### set up:
- install `sqlite3.h` from [sqlite.org](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) and put it in headers
- compile by 
```bash
g++ main.cpp src/user.cpp src/books.cpp src/database.cpp -o main -lsqlite3
```
