my first project in c++, just for practice 


### todo:
- [x] get into OOP (make classes??)
- [x] cmake 

### set up:
- install `sqlite3.h` from [sqlite.org](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) and put it in headers
- compile:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && cmake --build . && ./books
```
